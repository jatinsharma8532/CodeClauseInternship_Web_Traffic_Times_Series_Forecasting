<h1>Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting</h1>

This is a Kaggle competition problem which was held nearly 4 years ago. In this case study, we will be focusing on a time series problem. Let’s quickly define the Time-series. Time series is a set of observations recorded over regular intervals of time. Time series can be beneficial in many fields like stock market prediction, weather forecasting. Time series can come in handy in many problems like analysis, classification, and most important forecasting, in this case, a study we will be focusing on analysis and forecasting.

This case study focuses on predicting future values for multiple time series problems. Each time series contains daily traffic on the Wikipedia page for a total of 803 days from 2015–07–01 to 2017–09–10. We have a total of 145k time series which means we have data for 145k pages, our goal is to analyze this data, build a model on it and predict future traffic on each of the pages for 62 days from 2017–09–13 to 2017–11–13(well, it is not actually future but when this competition was held, it was!)
